- 1 cup of carrots, diagonally sliced into 1/4in thick rounds
- Optional veggies: long beans, spinach, broccoli, whatever you fancy ;)

- 2 tsp rice vinegar/fresh lime juice
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- Salt to taste

# Instructions
1. Heat a large skillet/wok over medium heat. Once hot, add a tbsp of olive oil. Add garlic, ginger, onion and cook until fragrant.  
2. Add bell peppers and carrots. Cook until it's tender.
3. Add curry paste and stir for a minute or two.
4. Add coconut milk, water, kale. Stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat. It should reduce a little.
